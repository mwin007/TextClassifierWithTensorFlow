# Text Classifire With TensorFlow

I used a DNNClassifier for the task of text classification. 

*"basic" contains my first step towards learning tensorflow
*"skyflow" contains a couple of classifiers (linear and naive bayes) developed using tensorflow. I used them to learn more about how to learn working with classifiers in tensorflow.
*"tf.contribute.learn" contains a sample code from tensorflow repository
*"pooyan" contains my classifier (DNN) and the dataset. I used spambase data set from UCI ML dataset repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)
