# Text Classifire With TensorFlow

I used a DNNClassifier for the task of text classification. 

* "basic" contains my first step towards learning tensorflow
* "skyflow" contains a couple of classifiers (linear and naive bayes) developed using tensorflow. I used them to educate myself, and to work with some classifiers in tensorflow.
* "tf.contribute.learn" contains a sample code from tensorflow repository
* "pooyan" contains my (DNN) classifier and a dataset from UCI ML dataset repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase).
